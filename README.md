# Router_1X3
This project implements a custom router designed for efficient packet switching and forwarding. It consists of multiple modules working together to ensure seamless data transmission.

A Router is a networking device that directs data packets between computer networks. It connects multiple devices to the internet and ensures efficient communication by forwarding data to the appropriate destinations. Routers play a crucial role in home and office networks, acting as a bridge between local networks (LAN) and external networks (WAN or the internet).
